# DASH

DASH or **D**ash: **A**daptable, **S**ecure, and **H**igh-performance CMS is a new CMS I use on my website and many of the websites I build and host. Its name gives an idea of what it is for and how it can be used. 

The move from hosting the only copy of DASH v2 on my website like Dash 1.x has been made so that hopefully DASH can be improved further. 

DASH used to be hosted on GitHub, but since I have created a new GitHub, you cannot see old commits.
