# DASH

DASH or Dash: Adaptable, Secure and High-performance CMS is a new CMS I use on my personal website as well as many of the websites I build and host. Its name gives an idea of what it is for and how it can be used. This iteration is version 2.0.

The move from hosting the only copy of DASH v2 on my website, as in Dash 1.x, is intended to help DASH improve more quickly and further.
